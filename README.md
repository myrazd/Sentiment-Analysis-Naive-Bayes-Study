# Sentiment-Analysis-Naive-Bayes-Study
This repository presents a study on sentiment analysis using the Naive Bayes classifier. It encompasses both theoretical insights and practical implementations. The theoretical segment was written based on concepts covered in the 'Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces' course by DeepLearning.AI on Coursera, providing a foundational understanding of NLP and classification techniques.

In the coding part, I explored sentiment analysis using a Naive Bayes classifier, leveraging a dataset obtained from Kaggle's 'Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets' competition. Through hands-on coding exercises, I examined preprocessing techniques, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

Please note that this study only scratches the surface of sentiment analysis, offering a starting point for further exploration and understanding.
